Iris Flower Detection Model

<br>Overview</br>
This repository contains a machine-learning model for detecting Iris flower species based on the famous Iris dataset. The model is implemented using scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library in Python, and is designed to classify Iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginia.

<br>Features</br>
Model Type: Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier with radial basis function (RBF) kernel.
Accuracy: Achieves high accuracy of 1.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Includes visualizations and analysis of the Iris dataset to gain insights into the distribution and relationships between different features.

<br>Files</br>
Iris_Flower_Detection.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the model implementation, training, and EDA.
requirements.txt: List of required Python libraries.

<br>Dataset</br>
The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning, containing measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for 150 Iris flowers, with 50 flowers from each of the three species.

<br>Acknowledgements</br>
The model and analysis in this repository are inspired by the scikit-learn documentation and various machine-learning tutorials.

Feel free to contribute, provide feedback, or use the model for your projects!
